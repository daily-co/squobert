# Squobert's Face

Squobert's face is a React app using the [Pipecat React SDK](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/react/introduction).

## Setup

To start, you'll need to point the client at your bot. Edit `src/providers/RTVIProvider.tsx` and look around line 20 for the `onConnect` handler.

```
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```
